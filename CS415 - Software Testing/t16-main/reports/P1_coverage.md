After looking at the coverage report from JaCoCo it looks like we missed a method in company, hashCode. There were no specifications on what to have hashCode do for Company so we chose to leave it unimplemented. It looks like some branches in the more complex methods of Company, but we are unsure if that is because of our tests or due to BCC missing some branches in larger methods. In total we missed  only 15 lines of code between the 4 classes. The ISP tables we created helped us in getting coverage that is so high. We wish that JaCoCo would give us more information on what was missed, line numbers, method names, etc.
