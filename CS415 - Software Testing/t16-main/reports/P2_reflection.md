# T16 P2 Reflection

After completeing P2 as a team there were a couple key things we noticed went well as well as issues we had during the sprint.

### Good
- Communication
- Merging in PR's
- Got started earlier than in P1
- Continued using the created Project
- Team help and coloaboration (working out problems)

### Not so good
- Not a clear picture of what to do from the start
- Understanding requirements

### What to do better
- Research more online if lectures are not up yet describing the tasks in the sprint
- Get a better grasp of sprint requirements from the beginning
