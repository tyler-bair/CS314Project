# T16 P3 Reflection

For our last sprint we worked well as a team and were able to complete the sprint tasks quickly and without issue.

### Good
- Task break up and implementation
- Bug finding from P1 implementation
- Communication
- Client design

### Not so good
- We didn't have any significant issues with this sprint
- We had some issues understanding what was expected with the use cases and test cases
