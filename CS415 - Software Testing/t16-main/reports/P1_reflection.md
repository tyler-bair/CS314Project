# T16 P1 Reflection

After completeing P1 as a team there were a couple key things we noticed went well as well as issues we had during the sprint.

### Good
- Communication
- Merging in PR's
- The ISP helped us in understanding what should be test
- Creating a GitHub project and issues at the start of the project
- Team help and coloaboration (working out problems)

### Not so good
- Waited too long to start
- Missing team member
- Not a clear picture of what to do from the start
- Understanding requirements
- What order to implement and test

### What to do better
- Start the project on time
- Get a better grasp of sprint requirements from the beginning
- Create an order for what to do
